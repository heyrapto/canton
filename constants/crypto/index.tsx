      question: "What is Canton Coin?",
      answer: [
        "Canton Coin (CC), the network's native utility token, was designed to reward real network usage over speculation. It aligns the success of the network with the participants who make it work, fairly rewarding app builders and app users, as well as those operating decentralized infrastructure. The result is a fundamentally different model where rewards flow to those creating value through real activity, not only miners or early investors.",
        "Canton's tokenomics aim to sidestep the pitfalls seen in earlier networks:",
        "No pre-mine, no VC allocations: Every token in circulation has been earned by delivering utility.",
        "Burn-and-Mint equilibrium: Usage fees are burned, and new coins are minted based on participation. This keeps supply responsive to demand and ties value to network usage.",
        "Enterprise-grade transparency: Even though transactions on Canton are private by default, reward distributions and Canton Coin fees are published, providing insight into what's driving value without compromising privacy."

      question: "How can I get Canton Coin?",
